# IIIFDexir Project  

The IIIFDexir project is a dynamic catalog based on IIIF. It emphasizes several technical features:  

## Key Features  

- Machine Readability: The catalog is designed to be machine-readable and consumable.
- Linked Data. IIIFDexir is fully compatible with Linked Data Paradigm and LOUD/FAIR concepts. 
- IIIF Compatibility: IIIFDexir is fully compatible with IIIF standards.  
- Hierarchical Arrangement: Resources in the catalog are all IIIF Manifests accessible online and are arranged hierarchically as nested Multipart IIIF Collection.  
- Flexible Data Structures: The data structures of the resources in the collection are JSON-LD compatible and highly flexible that can be enriched with external data sources, including XML, JSON, and RDF files.  
- Controlled Vocabularies: IIIFDexir is associated with standard controlled vocabularies and knowledge baeses like AAT, TGN, LCSH, TGM and Wikidata. In some circumestances I extend The AAT and TGM with new terms and concepts to demonstrate how easy is extending the contolled vocabularies.
- FHKB (Family History Knowledge Base). A Full version of FHKB is embeded into the project for the Agential data.  
- On The Fly Manifests. There are many use cases that we want to use a customize curated manifests from selected cavases that physically belong to other manifests. There is a python code to achive this goal which provided with some samples. These manifests are hosted locally.
- Human Usability: While the primary focus is on machine consumption, the catalog is also usable by humans via standard IIIF viewers like Mirador and OpenSeaDragon.  
- Public Accessibility: The catalog remains publicly accessible.

## Subset of AAT concepts used in IIIFDexir
AAT has a hierarchical structure with 7 Facets in root and  many sub Branches beneth them related to Art and Architecture which has very critical role in IIIFDexir.
Below is a subset of AAT collection with limited scope suitable for use in IIIFDexir:

## Important Notes

I aim to keep the catalog healthy despite daily changes in its structure and contents. As it expands, I make necessary modifications for enrichment. The final goal is a machine-readable catalog to present statistics and analytical information. Some resources reference external sources via the "seeAlso" field, which needs parsing. It's crucial to associate resources with controlled vocabularies like Getty's AAT and TGN, and the Library of Congress's TGM and SH.

## Preparing KG 
Creating a Knowledge Graph from the IIIFDexir is straightforward. IIIF Collections and Manifests are in JSON-LD format, but we used the Turtle format to implement a simple ontology for Data visualizatio representation. The primary entities are ResourceCollection (IIIF Collection) and DigitalResource (IIIF Manifest), both represented by owl:Class.

## Ontology

A blue print and schema of the project containg the Concepts and Entities as owl:Class and the relations between them. The classes have the hierarchical structure based on Inheritance and it enables us to create specialized classes that inherits general attributes from parents and then define new attributes and properties.

## IIIFDexir Workflow and RDF Ontology

This repository, [IIIFCollection](https://github.com/MehranDHN/IIIFCollection), provides a dynamic, machine-readable catalog based on the International Image Interoperability Framework ([IIIF](http://iiif.org)) standards, focusing on cultural, artistic, architectural, photographic, and literary resources related to Persia (Iran). This README outlines the workflow for utilizing the RDF ontology and IIIF Multipart Collections, highlights the distinction between **Departed Collections** and **Resource Collections**, and provides sample SPARQL queries to interact with the Knowledge Graph.

## Overview of IIIF Multipart Collections

IIIF Multipart Collections are structured to organize digital resources hierarchically, adhering to IIIF standards. These collections are represented as JSON-LD and are fully compatible with IIIF viewers like Mirador and OpenSeaDragon. The collections are designed to be both machine-readable and human-usable, supporting flexible data enrichment from external sources (e.g., XML, JSON, RDF Turtle) and alignment with controlled vocabularies such as Getty's AAT, TGN, Library of Congress's TGM, Schema.org, and Wikidata.

### Key Features of IIIF Multipart Collections
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Collections can contain nested sub-collections and IIIF Manifests, enabling a tree-like organization of resources.
- **Machine Readability**: JSON-LD format ensures compatibility with semantic web technologies.
- **Public Accessibility**: Resources are accessible online via standard IIIF viewers.
- **Dynamic Enrichment**: External data sources can be integrated to enhance metadata, often referenced via the `seeAlso` field in manifests.

## Refering to Contents
All the entries in this projectd designed as an IIIF Collection. Collection and Manifest are first level objects in IIIF Ecosystem and Canvasses are special type of object that typically can be integrated inside of a manifest. Refereing to Collection and manifest can be achived by `iiif-content` Query string in standard IIIF Viewers.
Thanks to IIIF Content State API we can use this method to access a canvas inside the manifest with a little differences.

Extending this sample to another level could prove truly transformative. Imagine each illustrated manuscript having its own dedicated, standalone data structure for every magnificent folio including the cover, opening pages, flyleaf, rosette, colophon, and beyond.
Additionally, each individual folio could be assigned its own specific, persistent URL, allowing it to be referenced, shared, and viewed independently without needing to navigate the entire manuscript. With the help of the `IIIF Content State API`, this vision becomes not only possible but highly practical. It opens up rich opportunities to enrich, annotate, and present each folio independently whether for scholarly analysis, educational use, high-resolution exhibition, or creative reinterpretation while maintaining the integrity and context of the complete manuscript.

### RDF Ontology: Departed Collections vs. Resource Collections

The RDF ontology, implemented in Turtle format, models two primary entities: **ResourceCollection** and **DigitalResource**, alongside other classes like `Creator`, `Publisher`, `ResourceType`, and `CanvasType`. Below, we differentiate between **Departed Collections** and **Resource Collections**:

### Departed Collections
- **Purpose**: Designed to integrate digital resources scattered across various institutions, such as museums or archives worldwide.
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Aggregates resources that are not necessarily related by subject but are unified by their cultural or historical significance to Persia.
  - Facilitates interoperability by linking disparate digital assets into a cohesive collection.
  - Often references external sources via the `seeAlso` field for additional metadata.
- **Use Case**: A Departed Collection might include manuscripts from a museum in London, photographs from an archive in Tehran, and books from a library in New York, unified under a shared cultural theme.

### Resource Collections
- **Purpose**: Organized by specific subjects (e.g., Persian architecture, calligraphy, or literature) with a hierarchical structure based on IIIF Collection capabilities.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Follows a tree-like organization where collections can contain sub-collections and manifests.
  - Aligned with controlled vocabularies (e.g., AAT, TGM, Wikidata) to categorize resources by type or theme.
  - Emphasizes structured, subject-based access to resources for both human and machine consumption.
- **Use Case**: A Resource Collection might focus on "Persian Miniature Paintings," with sub-collections for different artists or periods, each containing relevant IIIF Manifests.

### Ontology Representation
The ontology defines relationships such as `hasResource`, `hasCreator`, `hasPublisher`, and `hasResourceType` to link entities. For example:
- `mdhn:ResourceCollection` represents both Departed and Resource Collections, with `mdhn:partOf` indicating hierarchical relationships.
- `mdhn:DigitalResource` represents individual IIIF Manifests, linked to collections via `mdhn:belongsTo`.

### Transforming RDF Ontology to First-Order Logic

RDF ontologies can be translated into First-Order Logic (FOL) to enable formal reasoning, theorem proving, or integration with logical systems. In FOL, classes are represented as unary predicates (e.g., `ResourceCollection(x)`), while properties are binary predicates (e.g., `hasResource(x, y)`). Domain and range constraints are axiomatized using universal quantifiers to enforce type restrictions. Inverse properties are captured with equivalence axioms.

Below, we transform the key elements of the RDF ontology into FOL axioms, with a strong emphasis on the domain and range of each object and datatype property. Note that namespaces (e.g., `mdhn:`) are omitted for brevity in the predicates, but they align with the Turtle definitions.

### Classes as Unary Predicates
- `ResourceCollection(x)`: True if x is a resource collection.
- `DigitalResource(x)`: True if x is a digital resource (IIIF Manifest).
- `Creator(x)`: True if x is a creator entity.
- `Publisher(x)`: True if x is a publisher entity.
- `ResourceType(x)`: True if x is a resource type (aligned with vocabularies like AAT).
- `CanvasType(x)`: True if x is a canvas type within a manifest.

### Object Properties with Domain and Range
Each object property is represented as a binary predicate, with axioms for domain (subject type) and range (object type). Inverse relationships are also axiomatized.

- **hasResource(x, y)**  
  - Domain: ResourceCollection (∀x ∀y (hasResource(x, y) → ResourceCollection(x)))  
  - Range: DigitalResource (∀x ∀y (hasResource(x, y) → DigitalResource(y)))  
  - Inverse: belongsTo(y, x) (∀x ∀y (hasResource(x, y) ↔ belongsTo(y, x)))

- **hasCreator(x, y)**  
  - Domain: DigitalResource (∀x ∀y (hasCreator(x, y) → DigitalResource(x)))  
  - Range: Creator (∀x ∀y (hasCreator(x, y) → Creator(y)))  
  - Inverse: createResources(y, x) (∀x ∀y (hasCreator(x, y) ↔ createResources(y, x)))

- **hasCanvasType(x, y)**  
  - Domain: DigitalResource (∀x ∀y (hasCanvasType(x, y) → DigitalResource(x)))  
  - Range: CanvasType (∀x ∀y (hasCanvasType(x, y) → CanvasType(y)))  
  - No inverse defined.

- **ofType(x, y)**  
  - Domain: DigitalResource (∀x ∀y (ofType(x, y) → DigitalResource(x)))  
  - Range: ResourceType (∀x ∀y (hasResourceType(x, y) → ResourceType(y)))  
  - Inverse: hasTypeInstance(y, x) (∀x ∀y (hasTypeInstance(x, y) ↔ resourceTypeInstance(y, x)))

- **hasPublisher(x, y)**  
  - Domain: DigitalResource (∀x ∀y (hasPublisher(x, y) → DigitalResource(x)))  
  - Range: Publisher (∀x ∀y (hasPublisher(x, y) → Publisher(y)))  
  - Inverse: publishedResource(y, x) (∀x ∀y (hasPublisher(x, y) ↔ publishedResource(y, x)))

- **belongsTo(x, y)**  
  - Domain: DigitalResource (∀x ∀y (belongsTo(x, y) → DigitalResource(x)))  
  - Range: ResourceCollection (∀x ∀y (belongsTo(x, y) → ResourceCollection(y)))  
  - Inverse of hasResource.

- **publishedResource(x, y)**  
  - Domain: Publisher (∀x ∀y (publishedResource(x, y) → Publisher(x)))  
  - Range: DigitalResource (∀x ∀y (publishedResource(x, y) → DigitalResource(y)))  
  - Inverse of hasPublisher.

- **createResources(x, y)**  
  - Domain: Creator (∀x ∀y (createResources(x, y) → Creator(x)))  
  - Range: DigitalResource (∀x ∀y (createResources(x, y) → DigitalResource(y)))  
  - Inverse of hasCreator.

- **resourceTypeInstance(x, y)**  
  - Domain: ResourceType (∀x ∀y (resourceTypeInstance(x, y) → ResourceType(x)))  
  - Range: DigitalResource (∀x ∀y (resourceTypeInstance(x, y) → DigitalResource(y)))  
  - Inverse of hasResourceType.

- **subCollectionOf(x, y)**  
  - Domain: ResourceCollection (∀x ∀y (subCollectionOf(x, y) → ResourceCollection(x)))  
  - Range: ResourceCollection (∀x ∀y (subCollectionOf(x, y) → ResourceCollection(y)))  
  - Inverse: parentCollectionOf(y, x) (∀x ∀y (parentCollectionOf(x, y) ↔ subCollectionOf(y, x)))

- **partOf(x, y)**  
  - Domain: DigitalResource (∀x ∀y (partOf(x, y) → DigitalResource(x)))  
  - Range: DepartedCollection (∀x ∀y (partOf(x, y) → DepartedCollection(y)))  
  - Inverse: contains(y, x) (∀x ∀y (contains(x, y) ↔ partOf(y, x)))  

### Datatype Properties with Domain and Range
Datatype properties link entities to literal values (e.g., strings or URIs).

- **hasUrl(x, y)**  
  - Domain: ResourceCollection or DigitalResource (∀x ∀y (hasUrl(x, y) → (ResourceCollection(x) ∨ DigitalResource(x))))  
  - Range: xsd:anyURI (∀x ∀y (hasUrl(x, y) → URI(y)))  
  - (Where URI(y) represents y being a URI value.)

- **caption(x, y)**  
  - Domain: ResourceCollection or DigitalResource (∀x ∀y (caption(x, y) → (ResourceCollection(x) ∨ DigitalResource(x))))  
  - Range: xsd:string (∀x ∀y (caption(x, y) → String(y)))  
  - (Where String(y) represents y being a string literal.)

These FOL axioms provide a formal foundation for reasoning about the ontology, such as checking consistency or inferring relationships. Tools like theorem provers (e.g., Vampire or E Prover) can utilize these axioms for advanced queries beyond SPARQL.

### Workflow for Using RDF Ontology and IIIF Collections

1. **Accessing the Collection**:
   - Use a standard IIIF viewer (e.g., Mirador 3.0, OSD, Thesus, ... ) to explore the collection.
   - Retrieve JSON-LD manifests or collections via their URLs.

2. **Enriching Data**:
   - Parse external sources referenced in the `seeAlso` field to enrich metadata.
   - Align resources with controlled vocabularies (e.g., AAT, TGM) for semantic consistency.

3. **Building a Knowledge Graph**:
   - Convert JSON-LD manifests into RDF Turtle format using the provided ontology.
   - Use tools like Apache Jena or RDFLib to load and query the Knowledge Graph.

4. **Querying the Knowledge Graph**:
   - Execute SPARQL queries to extract insights, such as resource types, creators, or hierarchical relationships.

5. **Analyzing and Visualizing**:
   - Generate statistics or visualizations based on query results, leveraging the machine-readable structure.
   - Use IIIF viewers for human-readable exploration.


### Sample SPARQL Queries

Below are sample SPARQL queries to demonstrate how to interact with the Knowledge Graph built from the IIIFDexir ontology.

#### Query 1: List All Digital Collections with the number of resources
This query retrieves all `mdhn:ResourceCollection` instances and counts number of `mdhn:DigitalResource` instances in each of them.

```sparql
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX sc: <https://schema.org/>

select  ?collection (Count(?s) as ?resourceCount){
    ?s a mdhn:DigitalResource;
    (mdhn:isInCollection)* ?collection.
    ?collection a mdhn:ResourceCollection.


}
Group by ?collection
Order by Desc(?resourceCount)
```

####  Query 2: Find Creators of Digital Resources
This query lists creators and their labels associated with `DigitalResource` instances.

```sparql
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
SELECT ?resource ?creator ?label
WHERE {
  ?resource a mdhn:DigitalResource ;
            mdhn:hasCreator ?creator .
    ?creator rdfs:label ?label.
}
```

####  Query 3: Identify Hierarchical Structure of Resource Collections
This query retrieves parent-child relationships between `ResourceCollection` instances.

```sparql
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
SELECT ?parent ?child ?childLabel
WHERE {
  ?child a mdhn:ResourceCollection ;
    mdhn:subCollectionOf ?parent ;
    mdhn:caption ?childLabel .
}
```

####  Query 4: Resources by Type Using Controlled Vocabularies
This query finds `DigitalResource` instances associated with a specific resource type from Getty's AAT.

```sparql
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX aat: <https://vocab.getty.edu/aat/>
SELECT ?resource ?label
WHERE {
  ?resource a mdhn:DigitalResource ;
            mdhn:ofType mdhn:aat300027200 ;  # AAT term for "Photograph Album"
            rdfs:label ?label .
}
```
There is a difference between logical Collections and actual resource type. To get a full list of all members of `mdhn:PhotographAlbum` which is an instance of  `mdhn:ResourceCollection` the following Query can be use:

```sparql
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX sc: <https://schema.org/>

select ?s  ?reslabel{
    ?s a mdhn:DigitalResource;
       rdfs:label ?reslabel;
      mdhn:isInCollection mdhn:PhotographAlbum.

}
```

To limit the labels to specific Language:

```sparql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX aat: <https://vocab.getty.edu/aat/>
SELECT ?resource ?label
WHERE {
  ?resource a mdhn:DigitalResource ;
            mdhn:ofType mdhn:aat300027200 ;  # AAT term for "Photograph Album"
            rdfs:label ?label .
    FILTER(LANG(?label)="en")
    #BIND(LANG(?label) as ?languages)
    #FILTER(?languages IN ("fr", "en", "fa"))
}
```

####  Query 5: Accessing the specified folio type (Drawings) 
This query finds all matches that have the `mdhn:folioHasDrawing` flag, which is a flag to identify the drawing resources.
In future improvements, we should associate this feature with the particular Controlled Vocabulary designed to identify folio types.

```sparql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX aat: <https://vocab.getty.edu/aat/>
SELECT *
WHERE {
  ?resource a mdhn:DigitalResource ; 
            mdhn:folioHasDrawing ?drawing;
            mdhn:partOf ?part;
            rdfs:label ?label .
}
```
![Query 5](/IIIFCollection/images/FolioType.JPG)
It is obvious that we can use filters to limit the results only for specified physical or logical collection:

```sparql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX aat: <https://vocab.getty.edu/aat/>
SELECT *
WHERE {
  ?resource a mdhn:DigitalResource ; 
            mdhn:folioHasDrawing ?drawing;
            mdhn:partOf ?part;
            rdfs:label ?label .
  Filter(?part=mdhn:vcol1000111)
}
```
####  Query 6: Accessing the resources that somehow related to specified geo spatial TGN location
This query finds all resources that related to specified TGN location based on  `mdhn:hasTGNPlace` predicate. We also `mdhn:ofType` predicate as another dimension to find the resource types.
This query can be easily extended to group the results by resource types to count the resources associated to each type. 
The `mdhn:tgn1001228` is the part of the Isfahan URI which we reconciliate with the Getty's TGN .
See [TGN](http://vocab.getty.edu/tgn/1001228)

```sparql
PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX sc: <https://schema.org/>
select ?s  ?place ?restype ?typelbl {
    ?s a mdhn:DigitalResource;
      mdhn:ofType ?restype;
      mdhn:hasTGNPlace ?place.
    ?restype rdfs:label ?typelbl.
    Filter(?place=mdhn:tgn1001228)
    Filter(Lang(?typelbl)="en")
}
```

####  Query 7: Using agential info of the resources
This query finds all resources that marked with Agential information which is instances of  `fhkb:Person`. Those resources associate with `mdhn:hasAgential` predicate to the Agential info which is Adapted from FHKB.

See [Family History Knowledge Base (FHKB)](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/tutorial/fhkb/)

```sparql
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX sc: <https://schema.org/>

select ?person ?lblPerson{
    ?s a mdhn:DigitalResource;
       mdhn:hasAgential ?person.
    ?person rdfs:label ?lblPerson.
    Filter(Lang(?lblPerson)="fa")
}
```
![Query 7](/IIIFCollection/images/fhkbResult.JPG)

Accessing all resources that relate to specified person:
```sparql
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX sc: <https://schema.org/>

select ?person ?lblPerson{
    ?s a mdhn:DigitalResource;
       mdhn:hasAgential ?person.
    ?person rdfs:label ?lblPerson.
    Filter(?person=mdhn:Naser_al_Din_Shah_Qajar)
    Filter(Lang(?lblPerson)="fa")
}
```
####  Query 8: Accessing the resources that have Kufic script style excepts those in specified collection
This query finds all resources that has specified  `mdhn:aat300194434` script style which is Kufic script in AAT Thesaurus. We limit the results to all but those that are in specified Collection `mdhn:AsarolBaghieOrMs161`.


```sparql
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX sc: <https://schema.org/>
# ليست آثاری که به خط کوفی مرتبط هستند به استثنای مجموعه آثار الباقيه
select * {
    ?s a mdhn:DigitalResource;
       mdhn:hasScriptStyle mdhn:aat300194434;
       mdhn:isInCollection ?collection.
    Filter(?collection!=mdhn:AsarolBaghieOrMs161)
  
}
```
####  Query 9: Determinig which resources have the Subject headers that reconciliated against AAT and LCSH (Not The LCTGM)
This query finds all resources that have specified subject header types. Those that are `mdhn:AATTerm` and `mdhn:LCSHSubject` because all resources reconciliate against three primary sources inclusing `LCTGM`, `LCSH` and `AAT`.
```sparql
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT *
WHERE {
    ?s a mdhn:DigitalResource ;
       mdhn:hasSubject ?subject ;
       mdhn:isInCollection ?collection .

####  Query 10: Determinig the participants in resources with their roles 
This query finds all participants who involve somehow in resources. Roles such as `mdhn:hasParticipantInRolePhotographer` and `mdhn:hasParticipantInRoleIllustrator` are Object Properties which are `rdfs:subPropertyOf` the `mdhn:hasParticipantInRole` that enables us to integrate all participants of Digital Resources in an effective way.
```sparql
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX sc: <https://schema.org/>

SELECT *
WHERE {
    ?s a mdhn:DigitalResource ;
       mdhn:hasParticipantInRole ?Agential ;
       mdhn:isInCollection ?collection .
}
```
Obviously we can get all participants with one or more specified role:
```sparql
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX sc: <https://schema.org/>

SELECT *
WHERE {
    ?s a mdhn:DigitalResource ;
       mdhn:hasParticipantInRolePhotographer ?Agential ;
       mdhn:isInCollection ?collection .
}
```
Then execuating a query to get a result of aggregated agential info:
```sparql
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX sc: <https://schema.org/>

SELECT Distinct ?agential (Count(?s) as ?cs)
WHERE {
    ?s a mdhn:DigitalResource ;
       mdhn:hasParticipantInRole ?agential ;
       mdhn:isInCollection ?collection .
   
}
GROUP BY ?agential
```

####  Query 11: Filter the resources in specified physical collections based on particular Iconography Tag
This query finds all digital resources that has a particular Tag in specified Collection. This can be achieved with a combinations of  `mdhn:isInCollection` and `mdhn:depicts` and then using a `Filter` to narrow the result.
```sparql
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX sc: <https://schema.org/>

select * {
    ?s a mdhn:DigitalResource;
       mdhn:isInCollection mdhn:DepartedDrawing;
       mdhn:depicts ?icgtag.
    ?icgtag rdfs:label ?lbltag.
    Filter(Lang(?lbltag)="en")
    Filter(?icgtag=mdhn:Boat)
}
```

####  Query 12: Filter the resources in specified physical collections based on particular Agential info and his involvement role and narrowing the result to those have valid Iconography Tag
This query finds all digital resources that has a particular Tag in specified Collection. This can be achieved with a combinations of  `mdhn:isInCollection` ,`mdhn:depicts` and `mdhn:hasParticipantInRolePoet` and then using a `Filter` to narrow the result.
```sparql
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX sc: <https://schema.org/>

select *{
    ?s a mdhn:DigitalResource;
       mdhn:isInCollection mdhn:DepartedDrawing;
       mdhn:depicts ?iconography;
       mdhn:hasParticipantInRolePoet ?poet.
    ?s rdfs:label ?lblresource.
    Filter(Lang(?lblresource)="en")
    Filter(?poet=mdhn:Abul_Qasim_Firdawsi)
}
```

####  Query 13: All folios that belongs to manuscripts
This query finds all digital canvases that belongs to manuscripts. This can be achieved with a `mdhn:canvasOf` which assocates canvases to manuscripts. The data contain standalone URL based on IIIF Content State API.

```sparql
PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
PREFIX mdhn: <http://example.com/mdhn/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>


SELECT *
WHERE {
    ?s a mdhn:ResourceCanvas;
       rdfs:label ?canvasLabel;
       mdhn:canvasIndex ?idx;
       mdhn:folioNo ?foliono;
       mdhn:folioStandaloneURL ?url;
       mdhn:canvasOf ?res.
    ?res rdfs:label ?resLabel;   
}
ORDER BY ?idx
```
## On-the-Fly IIIF Manifest Generator
A flexible Python script that dynamically combines selected IIIF manifests into a single, local-compatible manifest (Presentation API 2.0 or 3.0).
Supports:

- Multiple sources with different base URLs and API versions
- Selecting specific canvases (by zero-based index) from each manifest
- Custom canvas labels using a user-defined template
- Optional table of contents (structures/ranges)
- Custom metadata (completely independent of source manifests)
- Mixed v2 and v3 source manifests (with annotation normalization)
- Detailed logging & validation to debug problems

This tool is particularly useful for creating curated selections from heterogeneous IIIF collections (e.g. mixing archive.org HV.* items with Chester Beatty Library Persian manuscripts or any other IIIF endpoints).


## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MehranDHN/IIIFCollection.git
   ```

2. **Explore the Collection**:
   - Open the collection in a IIIF viewer like Mirador.
   - Inspect JSON-LD files for manifests and collections.

3. **Work with the Ontology**:
   Creating a full GraphDB from the data that have provided required using a Local or Cloud GraphDB System. Ontotext Graph and Stardog Cloud Service are excellent choices.
   - Load the Turtle ontology (`iiifCollectionOntology.ttl`) into a triplestore (e.g., Apache Jena).
   - Load the Turtle (`aat_hierarchy.ttl`) which is a subset of the Standard AAT for the scope of this project.
   - Load the Turtle (`iconography_RDF.ttl`) which is a limited-scope for iconography based on WikiData.   
   - Load the Turtle (`ctl_vocabs.ttl`) which is a subset of Controlled Vocabularies.   
   - Load the Turtle (`LCTGM_RDF.ttl`), (`tgn_subset_updated.ttl`) and (`PersonsRDFData.ttl`).
   - Load the (`resources.ttl`) which is actual RDF data of the collection.      
   - Use SPARQL queries to analyze the Knowledge Graph.

4. **Contribute**:
   - Enrich the collection by adding new manifests or external metadata.
   - Help to better organizing the categorizations.
   - Submit pull requests for ontology updates or new SPARQL queries.

## Notes
- The catalog is dynamic and may undergo daily updates to its structure and contents.
- Ensure proper parsing of `seeAlso` fields to incorporate external metadata.
- The ontology is designed to be extensible, allowing integration with additional vocabularies or data sources.

## About
This project is a dynamic IIIF collection featuring a hierarchical catalog related to the culture, art, architecture, photographs, and books of Persia (Iran). It aims to provide a machine-readable, semantically rich resource for researchers, developers, and enthusiasts.
